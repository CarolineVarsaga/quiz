### ABOUT THIS PROJECT
In this assignment, our task was to create a quiz. The focus was on TypeScript. 

## General
The following requirements were to be included:
- Create a quiz with at least 20 questions.
- Each question should have 3 answer options, and only 1 answer option should be correct.
- The questions should be presented in random order, and you should display 10 questions per game round.
- If the user chooses to play again, the same 10 questions should not appear again.
- You should earn points for correct answers.
- Only one question should be displayed on the screen at a time.
- There should be a countdown timer. The timer should stop when all questions have been answered.
- A confirmation dialog should show how many questions the player answered correctly (out of the total number of questions) and how long it took.
- Each person should have made at least two pull requests.
- The code is correctly formatted.
- The code contains a few bugs but works overall.
- You have implemented at least one mobile version; if you reuse the same layout on tablet/desktop, that's fine.
- The page should be reasonably aesthetically pleasing (CSS).
- You have checked off "common mistakes" from previous tasks, both in HTML & CSS and JavaScript.
- The page has been accessibility-reviewed.
- The page has been validated.
- You have performed a Lighthouse analysis on the live page.

## Additional Information
Parallel to this course, we also studied Agile Project Work. We had daily meetings where we discussed our progress, what went well, and what could be improved. This allowed us to collaborate very effectively, and we utilized GitHub's backlog.

In this project, we built several HTML pages. While it added some complexity to our work, it provided us with good practice. Additionally, we implemented some technical features beyond the given specifications:

- A countdown timer set to 30 seconds. If a user does not respond within that time, they are forwarded to the next question. 
- We also created an animation that made the page redder the closer it got to 30 seconds.
- Duck-shaped buttons that slightly tilt when the mouse hovers over them.
- Saved data to local storage, such as the existing array of questions and the player's results.
- A high score list sorted based on points. It is also fetched on the start page.
- Users cannot proceed without selecting an answer option.
